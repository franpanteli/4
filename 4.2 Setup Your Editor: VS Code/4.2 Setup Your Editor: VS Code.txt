-> Introduction  
   -> What's free, open-source, and super useful?  
      -> It's a good ol' free Integrated Development Environment (IDE)  
      -> IDEs give you a place to type your code into and try executing it  
      -> In this lesson, you'll learn about VS Code, how to install it, and helpful Flask VS Code extensions  

-> Why use VS Code?  
   -> In this Python + Flask course, you will be working with the lightweight VS Code IDE  
   -> Advantages of VS Code include:  
      -> Free and open-source  
      -> Extensions (also free) that make web development easier (e.g. syntax highlighting for Django templates)  
      -> Broad community support  
      -> Integrated debugging and seamless use of your terminal  
   -> If you have a different favourite code editor, feel free to use it instead  
      -> This course will use VS Code throughout, so it will be easier to follow along if you choose the same editor  
   -> VS Code has rightfully gained a lot of positive attention and is a useful tool to know  

-> Install VS Code  
   -> To get up and running, please follow CodingNomads' VS Code installation guide, then return here  

-> VS Code extensions  
   -> Once you have your text editor installed and set up, install the following extensions to aid in your Flask web app development quest:  
      -> **Jinja**: Jinja template language support for Visual Studio Code  
      -> **Jinja2 Snippet Kit**: Jinja2 snippets for cool attractive people to use in your HTML templates  
      -> **Python**: Linting, Debugging (multi-threaded, remote), Intellisense, Jupyter Notebooks, code formatting, refactoring, unit tests, snippets, and more  
      -> **Trailing Spaces**: Highlight trailing spaces and delete them in a flash  
      -> **AutoTrim**: Automatically trims trailing whitespace when moving the cursor from one line to another  

-> Additional Settings  
   -> There's also a file auto-save feature in VSCode's settings  
      -> To toggle it, head to **File -> Preferences -> Settings...** and search for "Files: Auto Save"  
   -> For normal users who want to save their files manually every once in a while, this feature is not recommended  

-> Now that you've got your code editor set up, it's time to download the lab used in this course
